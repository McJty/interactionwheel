This mod adds an interactive Interaction Wheel that you can access by pressing 'x' (default key). It supports various actions that you can easily access directly from that wheel. Currently supported are:

* Search item in nearby inventories
* Rotate block
* Dump all in inventory
* Fetch all from inventory
* Dump all similar items to inventory
* Automatically select the right tool to harvest the block you are looking at
* And more... (also mod specific interactions)

## **Note!** This mod works on 1.10.2 *and* 1.11.2 with the same JAR! But note that 1.12 requires a different JAR.

There is an API for other mods so that they can add their own wheel actions. RFTools and Immersive Craft do this for example.
This mod supports 1.10.2, 1.11, and 1.11.2
You are free to use this mod in any modpack without restrictions
